// a human reading the file sees a failure. Which value a release decision was
// made from must not depend on a parser's choice, and there is no reading of a
// duplicated field that is evidence of anything. The rule is deliberately
// blanket rather than a list of fields that matter: an exemption list is a
// place for the next contract field to be forgotten.
//
// Exact spelling is not the boundary, because it is not where encoding/json
// draws it. Struct field matching prefers an exact tag match and then falls
// back to a case-insensitive one, so `"verdict"` and `"Verdict"` in the same
// object both bind to Verdict and the later one wins. Measured against the real
// schema types: `verdict`/`Verdict`/`VERDICT`/`vErDiCt` collide, as do
// `profile_id`/`PROFILE_ID`, `required`/`Required`, `summary`/`Summary` and
// `targets`/`Targets`. Removing the underscore (`profileid`) or spelling the Go
// field name (`ProfileID`) does not collide, so no such transformation is
// applied here -- the rule matches the decoder's behaviour and nothing more.
//
// Keys are therefore compared case-folded, exactly as the decoder compares
// them. This does mean two unrelated extension keys differing only in case are
// refused; the alternative is a path-aware model of which objects are structs,
// which is the schema written twice and wrong the first time a field is added.
