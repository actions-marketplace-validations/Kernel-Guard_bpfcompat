// Package regressiondiff compares two bpfcompat evidence reports and reports

// It answers exactly one question: "did this candidate break an environment my
// baseline supported?" It is not a second compatibility classifier. It never
// re-reads validator logs, never re-runs anything, and never infers a verdict
// of its own -- it consumes the structured verdict, environment and
// completeness fields the run itself recorded.
//
// The separate internal/compare package predates the Gate 1 verdict contract
// and ranks statuses ordinally (pass 3 > fail 2 > infra_error 1). That makes a
// VM which failed to boot read as a regression, and makes a genuine
// incompatibility appearing where there was an infra error read as an
// improvement. It is still used by the frozen experimental API and is left
// alone; nothing here builds on it.
