## Candidate title

**Kernel Version Is Not a Capability Contract: Empirical eBPF Artifact
Compatibility Across Linux Vendor Kernels**

## Draft abstract

eBPF portability is commonly reasoned about using kernel version, CO-RE, and
upstream feature-introduction points. Linux distributions, however, ship vendor
kernels with backports, rebases, configuration differences, and project-specific
loader behavior that can invalidate simple version-based compatibility
assumptions. We present BPFCompat, an empirical compatibility harness that boots
real Linux distribution kernels in disposable virtual machines and executes
compiled eBPF artifacts through libbpf or project-specific loader paths.

A frozen x86_64 pilot study executed seven validation cases across ten logical
Linux profiles, producing 70/70 planned execution records. Fifty observations
were compatible, thirteen incompatible, and seven inconclusive because one
Oracle Linux logical profile requested a 5.15 kernel family but the vendor image
booted 6.12 UEK. Excluding the calibration case, the pilot contains 50 compatible,
4 incompatible, and 6 inconclusive observations. For a controlled
`BPF_MAP_TYPE_RINGBUF` probe, a simple upstream Linux 5.8 threshold agreed with
8 of 9 conclusive observations; AlmaLinux 8's observed 4.18 vendor kernel was
the below-threshold compatible exception. The dataset also contains two
cross-vendor version inversions in which an older-numbered kernel passed while a
newer-numbered kernel failed. A purposefully stratified post-collection repeat
sample then reran seven canonical tuples three times each. All 21/21 repeats
matched the canonical verdict on the same exact environment; no environment
drift or same-environment verdict instability was observed in that bounded
sample.

These results are descriptive evidence from a selected pilot, not population
estimates for Linux deployments. The study publishes normalized evidence,
exact-environment identities, checksums, provenance, and deterministic analysis
scripts so the reported findings can be reproduced from the committed versioned
repository dataset.

## Claimed contributions

1. A reproducible method for testing compiled eBPF artifacts against real
   vendor kernels instead of inferring compatibility from version strings.
2. A provenance model that separates logical kernel profiles from the exact
   environments that actually booted.
3. A frozen pilot dataset with 70 execution records and deterministic RQ1–RQ4
   analysis.
4. Empirical examples showing that kernel-version ordering is not sufficient to
   define a capability ordering when vendor backports are present.
5. Loader-path observations using both libbpf and project-specific Cilium/Falco
   execution paths, while explicitly avoiding unsupported causal claims.

## Research questions

- **RQ1:** How predictive is kernel version of observed eBPF compatibility?
- **RQ2:** Why do otherwise portable eBPF artifacts fail?
- **RQ3:** How much does the loader affect the observed compatibility verdict?
- **RQ4:** How do vendor backports and exact execution environments change the
  relationship between kernel version and compatibility?

## Pilot results to preserve verbatim

- collection: 70/70 attempts;
- overall: 50 compatible, 13 incompatible, 7 inconclusive;
- non-calibration: 60 attempts, 50 compatible, 4 incompatible, 6 inconclusive;
- RQ1 ring-buffer threshold agreement: 8/9 conclusive observations (88.889%);
- below-threshold compatible profile: `almalinux-8-4.18`;
- non-calibration incompatibility taxonomy:
  - `UNSUPPORTED_MAP_TYPE`: 2;
  - `COMMAND_VALIDATION_FAILURE`: 2;
- paired Cilium-derived paths: 0 verdict disagreements across 9 conclusive exact
  environments, with non-comparable load+attach versus load-only contracts;
- exact environments: 10;
- cross-vendor version inversions: 2;
- patch-level longitudinal change: not evaluable in pilot v1.

The source of truth for these values is
`research/analysis/v1/generated/analysis-summary.json`, not this prose.

## Planned figures and tables

### Figure 1 — study architecture

Artifact/source selection → deterministic materialization → exact vendor VM
environment → BPFCompat/real-loader execution → normalized evidence → RQ analysis.

### Figure 2 — ring-buffer version prediction versus observation

Plot each conclusive ring-buffer observation by observed kernel series, mark the
upstream 5.8 threshold, and highlight the AlmaLinux 8 / 4.18 compatible
below-threshold observation. The plot must make vendor identity visible so it
cannot be read as a continuous kernel-version benchmark.

### Figure 3 — compatibility matrix

Rows: study cases. Columns: exact environments/logical profiles. Cells:
compatible, incompatible, or inconclusive. Calibration must be visually
separated from field/primary cases.

### Table 1 — frozen corpus and validation contracts

For each case: artifact class, source revision, loader, execution mode, analysis
role, and immutable contract identity.

### Table 2 — failure taxonomy

Report calibration and non-calibration denominators separately. Do not combine
the nine calibration incompatibilities with the four non-calibration
incompatibilities.

### Table 3 — exact environment provenance

Logical profile, distro/release, requested kernel family, observed kernel
release, image SHA-256, exact environment ID, and evaluability.

### Table 4 — repeat-run stability

Canonical repeat run `35445834557` executed seven purposefully selected tuples
three times each:

| Measure | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Planned attempts | 21 |
| Observed attempts | 21 |
| Stable on the same exact environment | 21 |
| Environment drift | 0 |
| Same-environment verdict instability | 0 |

This table is a bounded stability check, not an estimate of a population-wide
nondeterminism rate. The source of truth is
`research/repeat/v1/data/stability-summary.json`.

## Limitations

- selected, stratified x86_64 pilot; not representative of global Linux
  deployments;
- only one exact environment per logical profile in the canonical collection;
- Oracle 5.15 logical profile was not actually available in the observed run;
- the paired Cilium paths have different validation contracts, so agreement is
  not a pure loader-effect estimate;
- project-loader coverage is intentionally narrow;
- patch-level longitudinal effects are not estimable from pilot v1.

## Publication gates

Do not convert this working draft into a submission-ready manuscript until:

1. the committed 21-attempt repeat-run stability snapshot remains verifiable;
2. final figures/tables are generated from normalized data;
3. the v1 archival/redistribution manifest passes;
4. a research-tagged immutable release is created;
5. the release/data package is deposited in a DOI-granting archive;
6. the DOI and exact release version are added to `CITATION.cff`.

Academic references or university resource-page links should be added only
after they are independently verifiable, and should be described as
`referenced by` or `cited by`, not as approval or endorsement.
