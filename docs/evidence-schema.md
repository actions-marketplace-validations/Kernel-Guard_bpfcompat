# bpfcompat evidence schema (v0.1)

The compatibility report is bpfcompat's core artifact: a portable, machine-readable
record of whether a compiled eBPF object loads (and attaches) on each target kernel,
**with a classified reason when it does not**. The classification taxonomy and this
stable format — not the VM layer — are what make the evidence reusable across CI,
dashboards, and audits.

- Product meaning of these fields: [compatibility-contract.md](compatibility-contract.md)
- Source of truth: [`pkg/schema/report_v0_1.go`](../pkg/schema/report_v0_1.go)
- `schema_version`: **`v0.1`**
- Stability policy: see [schema-stability-contract.md](schema-stability-contract.md)
  (additive within a major; breaking changes bump the major; consumers gate on
  `schema_version` and ignore unknown fields/enum values).

## Top level

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | string | Always present. Gate on this. |
| `run` | object | `{ id, started_at }` |
| `artifact` | object | `{ path, source?, source_digest?, basename, sha256, size_bytes }` — the validated `.bpf.o` or synthetic command identity; `source` preserves the original OCI reference and `source_digest` the immutable image digest it resolved to |
| `command` | object, optional | Command-mode invocation digest, expected exit code, and optional loader binary name/size/SHA-256. Command text is not persisted. |
| `validator` | object, optional | Artifact-mode libbpf validator binary name, size, and SHA-256. The staged bytes are reused for every target. |
| `matrix` | object | `{ path, name?, profiles[] }` — the kernel set requested |
| `targets[]` | array | one entry per kernel profile (below) |
| `summary` | object | `{ status, verdict?, complete?, notes[]? }` — `status` is `pass`/`fail`/`error`; `verdict` is `COMPATIBLE`/`INCOMPATIBLE`/`INFRA_ERROR`; `complete: false` means at least one target produced no compatibility answer |
| `paths` | object | `{ run_dir, json, markdown? }` |

## `targets[]` — per-kernel result

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `profile_id` | string | e.g. `ubuntu-22.04-5.15` |
| `required` | bool | whether this target gates the run. Only required targets set the run verdict and exit code — for **any** outcome, including infrastructure failure and an environment mismatch. Optional targets report information and reduce `summary.complete`, never the gate |
| `status` | string | `pass` \| `fail` \| `partial` \| `infra_error` \| `unsupported` |
| `verdict` | enum | `COMPATIBLE` \| `INCOMPATIBLE` \| `INFRA_ERROR` \| `UNSUPPORTED` — see [compatibility-contract.md](compatibility-contract.md) |
| `environment` | object | `{ requested_kernel_family, observed_kernel, kernel_family_match, image_source_url, image_sha256 }` — `kernel_family_match: false` means this target ran a different kernel series than the profile requested and cannot support a claim about it |
| `profile` / `host` | object | `{ distro, version, kernel_family, kernel, arch }` (requested vs actual) |
| `validation` | object | `{ load_status, load_error_code, load_error, attach_mode, attach_status, attach_attempted, attach_passed, attach_failed }` |
| `functional` | object | optional behavior tests: `{ status, tests[] }` |
| `btf` | object | `{ kernel_btf_available, artifact_has_btf, artifact_has_btf_ext }` |
| `failed_stage` | string | `load` \| `attach` \| `functional` \| `command` \| `transport` \| `infra` |
| `classification_code` | enum | **why it failed** — see taxonomy below |
| `classification_confidence` | string | `high` \| `medium` \| `low` |
| `classification_reason` | string | human-readable explanation |
| `started_at` / `finished_at` / `duration_ms` | — | timing |
| `validator_exit` / `notes[]` | — | validator detail |

### Sanitized (public) reports omit host internals

When `BPFCOMPAT_API_REDACT_RUNTIME_DETAILS` is set (the public demo posture), the
server strips host-revealing fields before returning a report: `vm_run_dir`,
`qemu_command`, `serial_log`, `validator_result`, and any absolute audit paths.
Self-hosted runs (your own CI, the CLI) keep the full detail locally.

## Classification taxonomy

The stable set of `classification_code` values, each with the remediation bpfcompat
suggests. This is the part that turns a raw libbpf/verifier error into an actionable
cause — and the part that compounds in value as more real-world failures are catalogued.

| Code | Meaning | Typical remediation |
|---|---|---|
| `MISSING_BTF` | Kernel has no embedded BTF for CO-RE | Non-CO-RE fallback, external BTF (BTFHub), or drop the CO-RE dependency for that band |
| `CORE_RELOCATION_FAILURE` | A CO-RE relocation could not be applied | Validate against the target BTF layout; ship a profile-specific variant where field layouts diverge |
| `UNSUPPORTED_PROGRAM_TYPE` | Program type not available on this kernel | Older-kernel-compatible variant (e.g. avoid fentry/fexit before 5.5) |
| `UNSUPPORTED_MAP_TYPE` | Map type not available (e.g. ringbuf < 5.8) | Map-compatible fallback (e.g. perfbuf instead of ringbuf) |
| `UNSUPPORTED_ATTACH_TYPE` | Attach/hook not available | Change the hook strategy, or make attach optional in the manifest |
| `POLICY_DENIED` | Host policy blocked load/attach | Check kernel lockdown, unprivileged-BPF sysctl, capabilities, runner policy |
| `CAPABILITY_FAILURE` | A probed helper/map/prog capability failed | Compare against the target profile; select a compatible variant |
| `VERIFIER_REJECTION` | The verifier rejected the program | Inspect the validator/libbpf log in the report |
| `FUNCTIONAL_TEST_FAILURE` | Loaded, but a behavior test failed | Inspect the functional command output / project test assets |
| `COMMAND_VALIDATION_FAILURE` | Command mode: the project's own loader exited with an unexpected code | Inspect `functional.tests[].stderr_tail`; the shipped loader failed on this kernel |
| `UNSUPPORTED_TRANSPORT` | bpfcompat has no execution transport for this profile — **not** a statement about the artifact (`verdict: UNSUPPORTED`) | Route the profile to a supported executor, or mark it optional |

Consumers should treat unknown codes as a generic failure (forward-compatible).
