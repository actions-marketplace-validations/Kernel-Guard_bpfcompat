# Guard the bpfcompat pins that appear in user-facing docs.
#
# v0.3.6 shipped an action that hard-failed on every amd64 runner. The bug was
# fixed in v0.3.7, but README.md, docs/*.md and all four docs/integrations
# templates kept pointing at v0.3.6 for two weeks, so every documented
# copy-paste path stayed broken. Nothing in CI noticed, because no check ever
# looked at the pins in the docs.
#
# This asserts three things about every `Kernel-Guard/bpfcompat@<ref>` we
# publish:
#   1. a commit-SHA pin carries a `# vX.Y.Z` comment naming the release it is,
#   2. that comment is true -- the tag really does resolve to that commit, and
#   3. every documented pin names the same version, so docs cannot drift apart.
#
# Only `uses:` lines are checked -- those are the copy-paste surface a reader
# actually runs. Prose that names an old version inside a dated evidence record
# (docs/external-ci-proof.md) is history, not an instruction, and is left alone.
# `@main` and `@latest` are deliberate and exempt, as is any line carrying an
# explicit `doc-pins: allow` marker.
